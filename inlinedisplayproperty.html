<h1 id="red"> I still rise by Maya Angelou </h1>

<p class="blue"> You may write me down in history </p>
<p class="blue"> With your bitter, twisted lies, </p>
<p> You may tread in the very dirt </p>
<p> But still, like dust, I'll rise. </p>
<p class="blue"> Does my sassiness upset you? </p>
<p> Why are you best with gloom? </p>
